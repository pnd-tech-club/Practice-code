# SVISH

A lightweight, hackable, shell that's a work in progress by the PNDTC for shiggles.

SVISH probably only works on UNIX-based systems.

SVISH stands for SVI SHell, SVI stands for something, but nobody is really sure what.

_Note_: All binaries in this directory structure are almost certainly compiled on x86_64 gnu/linux.
